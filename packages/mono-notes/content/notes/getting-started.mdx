# Getting Started

Install Gatsby and the themes as dependencies.

```sh
npm i gatsby react react-dom gatsby-theme-notes gatsby-theme-mono
```

Add the themes to your Gatsby config.
Be sure `gatsby-theme-mono` is last in the `plugins` array.

```js
// gatsby-config.
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    'gatsby-theme-notes',
    'gatsby-theme-mono',
  ]
}
```

Add MDX notes to `/content/notes/`.

Run `gatsby develop` to see your new site.
