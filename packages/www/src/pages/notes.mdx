Just random thoughts, don't read into too much here...

## Styling

- Global theme context
- Gatsby themes should use functional approaches to allow outer theme context to override any defaults

## Layouts

- Theme A provides some minimally styled layout components
- these can be imported and used by end-users to build layouts wherever

```jsx
// example user layout using Theme A
import React from 'react'
import {
  Layout,
  Header,
  Main,
  Footer,
} from 'theme-a'

export default props =>
  <Layout>
    <Header>
      This could be hard-coded, populated with data from GraphQL, or whatever
    </Header>
    <Main>
      {props.children}
    </Main>
    <Footer>
      footer content
    </Footer>
  </Layout>
```

- Theme B is an extension of Theme A
- it adds some typographic and color flourish to the base theme
- it also exposes the same layout component API
- internally, Theme B imports Theme A layout components and re-exports the altered components

```jsx
// example user layout using Theme B
import React from 'react'
import {
  Layout,
  Header,
  Main,
  Footer,
} from 'theme-a'

export default props =>
  <Layout>
    <Header>
      This could be hard-coded, populated with data from GraphQL, or whatever
    </Header>
    <Main>
      {props.children}
    </Main>
    <Footer>
      footer content
    </Footer>
  </Layout>
```

Essentially layouts in Gatsby themes are just React components and don't need to hook into Gatsby APIs.
