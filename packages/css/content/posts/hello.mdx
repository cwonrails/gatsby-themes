# Hello

This is an experimental Gatsby MDX blog theme built with CSS modules.
It uses the same theme specification as [Theme UI][],
but uses CSS custom properties and lets you write styles with CSS modules.
Thus, this does **not** include many of the features included in Theme UI, and is only meant as a demonstration of reusing theme objects with different implementations.

**This is for demonstration purposes only**
and isn't an officially recommended way of building Gatsby themes,
since styles can still leak into other pages outside of this theme.

If you're less familiar with CSS-in-JS libraries like Emotion,
this theme is meant to be a gentler introduction to some of the features and concepts found in Theme UI.
The `src/theme.js` module can be shadowed in order to customize the look and feel of this theme without needing to shadow other components.
Colors, typography, and some layout styles can be adjusted directly from the theme, and all other styles are in `src/styles.module.css`.
