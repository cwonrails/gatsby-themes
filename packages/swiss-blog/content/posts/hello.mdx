title: Hello, Swiss

This is `gatsby-theme-blog` with `gatsby-theme-swiss`.
The two themes compose *horizontally*.
Both themes use [Theme UI][] for styles.
The blog theme creates blog post pages from markdown,
and the Swiss theme customizes the colors and typography.

`gatsby-theme-swiss` will also work will `gatsby-theme-notes`.
Since this theme is only changing the Theme UI config,
it should generally work with any other Gatsby theme that's
built with Theme UI.

```js
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    'gatsby-theme-blog',
    'gatsby-theme-swiss',
  ]
}
```
